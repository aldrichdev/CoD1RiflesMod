First set up a halftime variable at the top of the code

Then find in AWE a place where the code handles SD round ending and put in this logic:

1. check that we are currently half way through the match; in other words, make sure the current round number is half the max rounds number + 1. if we are NOT currently halfway, do not switch, otherwise do the switch

I.E. 8 rounds: we want to switch on round 5, so check that the current round is 8/2 + 1 = 5

3. to do the switch follow the contents of the Do_Half_Time() function in _pam_sd.gsc for cod1. steps:

a. first switch scores. first make a backup variable of the axis score. then set the axis score to allies score and the allies score to the backup variable score of axis. 

b. then switch the players. loop through all players, and if they are on axis, set their pers[team] to allies, and vice versa for allies. then in the IF statemets save the player's savedmodel to a var like axisssavedmodel and alliessavedmodel.

c. then, swap the models. if the player is on axis, set their savedmodel to axisssavedmodel, etc vice versa for allies

d. make players drop weapons and put them in spec

e. swap the head icons

f. respawn all players with the correct weapons.
